# Video_Analytics

**Video_Analytics** is an intelligent video processing project that integrates object detection, tracking, and Visual Language Models (VLMs) to analyze and store features from multiple camera feeds in a structured SQL database. The system supports feature-based queries, enabling users to search for activities like "red shirt guy" and retrieve relevant video logs and feeds with robotic process automation (RPA) for streamlined operations.

## Features

- **Object Detection and Tracking**: Real-time object identification and movement tracking across multiple camera feeds.
- **Visual Language Models (VLMs)**: Advanced feature extraction for semantic queries.
- **Database Management**: Organized storage and retrieval of features using SQL.
- **Search Functionality**: Query video logs and feeds using descriptive keywords like clothing color or object presence.
- **Automation**: RPA-enabled workflows for camera integration, data management, and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming**: Python
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Automation**: RPA tools like UiPath or Automation Anywhere
- **APIs**: Flask/Django for backend integration

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Video_Analytics.git
   cd Video_Analytics
   2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Set up the database
Configure your SQL database connection in the .env file and initialize the schema.

bash
Copy code
python setup_database.py

4. Run the application
bash
Copy code
python app.py
 
Usage
Add Cameras: Connect multiple camera streams to the application.
Feature Extraction: Automatically detect and store object and feature data in the database.
Search: Use the search interface to find activities or objects in the feeds.

Future Enhancements
Integration with cloud-based storage for scalability.
Extended support for audio-based features.
Improved real-time alerting for specific detections.
